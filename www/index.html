There are options listed below for recycling these materials. DART Container Corporation in North Aurora has a drop off location at their site. Their address, phone number and a link are provided below for information. Please note they do not accept packaging peanuts; see below for instructions on that.</td></tr>

They may be glad to take them. There is actually a <strong>Peanut Hotline</strong> that will give you a location in the area. The number is 800-828-2214.</td></tr>

Swirled compact fluorescent bulbs may be taken to any Lowes or Home Depot for recycling (see the service desk). Regular fluorescent tube-style bulbs should be brought to the Naperville Fire Station #4 during their regular Household Hazardous Waste Drop-off times.</td></tr>
